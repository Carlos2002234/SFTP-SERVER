# Project Name : PowerShell Command Encoding Detection and Analysis in Azure Sentinel

## Overview
This project uses Azure Sentinel to detect encoded PowerShell commands on devices. The query identifies events with encoded PowerShell flags, extracts and decodes base64 strings, and summarizes unique decoded commands. The results trigger incidents, activating a playbook that sends an email with detailed information for further investigation

Example:
This project helps to create analytic rules in Azure Sentinel to monitor specific activities and generate incidents based on certain queries.
